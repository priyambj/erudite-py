Hi there. So this is going to be an interesting, fairly short course. We've primarily built it to help you learn more about Backbone.js. Backbone.js is a library that helps you organize your web applications. If you're completely new to organizing web applications consider going through JavaScript design patterns first. I've put a link to that course in the instructor notes. Now i'm going to be honest with you, learning about backbone is an important objective for this course but it's not my only objective. The other objective I have is for you to refine your ability to learn new things by exploring resources on the internet. This is a critical trait to have for any professional web developer. So here's how the course is going to work. We've created a list of resources from the internet. Things you might find in a Google search to help you get more familiar with Backbone. Spend the time to really go through each resource. Now, trust me on this, these resources will help you get better. I've read them all myself and they're all pretty good. Also, don't rush. You'll be spending between 30 and 90 minutes on each one. For each resource, we also will give you the opportunity to engage with your peers. Ask an answer each other's questions. Teaching is another incredible way to solidify your own knowledge, so help each other out. Once you're done with these resources you'll be in a great place to tackle your next project. Now let's dive into those resources.
